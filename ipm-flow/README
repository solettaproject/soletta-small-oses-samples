This samples shows a simple communication between two cores
on Zephyr using Soletta flow. It can be tested on an Arduino 101, for
instance. This board have two cores: one ARC and one Quark (x86).
Directories `x86/` and `arc/` have program that runs on x86 and ARC
core, respectively.

Building and flashing:

Make sure that `sol-fbp-generator` is on PATH and `libsoletta.so` is on
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

On x86 dir:

    make -C ../../BUILD/ zephyr BOARD=arduino_101 KERNEL_TYPE=nano ARCH=x86 flash

Or, if building for microkernel:

    make -C ../../BUILD/ zephyr BOARD=arduino_101 ARCH=x86 flash

On arc dir:

    make -C ../../BUILD/ zephyr BOARD=arduino_101_sss KERNEL_TYPE=nano ARCH=arc flash

Then, you should see on Arduino 101 serial, for instance, both cores
exchanging messages. One core should send a set of packets to the other
and vice-versa.
